#summary Monkey Testing.

The BSD kernel has been previously used for random/monkey testing research. The entropy used by these tools will often make root cause analysis [http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/arch/2009-01/msg00053.html difficult and time consuming].

This frame used a new approach: split the monkey tool into two parts: one tool uses entropy to generate a file system operation list and another tool that replays this pre-generated operation list.

Using pre-generated operation lists is a win due to the future improvements this technique enables:
   * competitive algorithms can be used to create operation lists that maximize bug count
   * [http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/fuzzing-at-scale.html corpus distillation] techniques can be used to create operation lists that maximize code coverage
   * regression test suites can be created using a set of minimized operation lists that have caused past regressions
   * improvements can be made to the front end without effecting existing regression tests
   * [http://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/people/macro/DEC/DTJ/DTJT08/DTJT08PF.PDF automated techniques] can be developed to reduce a successful operation list to the minimum required to reproduce the failure in the software under test
